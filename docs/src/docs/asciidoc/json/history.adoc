The current release is {version}. Below is a version history.

*1.3.0*

* The `includes` support has changed in a way that may break existing use cases. Having `includes: ['captain', 'captain.name']]` previously excluded all other fields except for `captain.name`. The `captain` in the list was necessary for `captain.name` to function as expected. Now the `captain` entry will cause all fields in `captain` to be rendered. To restore the previous behavior, simply remove the `captain` entry.  `includes: ['captain', 'captain.name']` -> `includes: ['captain.name]`.
