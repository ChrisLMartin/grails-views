Since JSON views are compiled all of a plugin's views and templates are available for use in your applications.

==== Customizing the Compile Task
NOTE: Unless otherwise configured, the project name of the plugin (the gradle `project.name`) is used as the `packageName`.  The view/template resolution mechanism attempts to use the Plugin's short name (`plugin.fileSystemShortName`) to resolve the resource.  If the two do not match it is neccesary to configure this package name to match the plugins' short name.
You would accomplish this by customizing the `compileGsonViews` task in the plugin's `build.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
compileGsonViews {
    packageName = "my-plugin-name"
}
